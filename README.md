🌍 Social Impact
The Distributed Library for Knowledge Sharing promotes a culture of collaboration, sustainability, and inclusivity within the campus. By allowing students to donate and share books directly, this peer-to-peer system removes traditional access barriers and redefines how academic resources are distributed and utilized.

Through this decentralized model:

📘 Knowledge becomes more accessible, especially for students who may struggle to afford or locate specific books in the central library.

🤝 Students are empowered to contribute, encouraging a sense of ownership, responsibility, and community-driven learning.

🔁 Books are repurposed and reused, reducing waste and promoting a sustainable approach to educational resource management.

This initiative ultimately fosters equitable learning, reduces academic disparity, and builds a stronger, more connected student ecosystem.
